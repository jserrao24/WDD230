          Lausanne is the capital and largest city of the Swiss canton of Vaud.
          It is a hilly city, situated on the shores of Lake Geneva, about
          halfway between the Jura Mountains and the Alps, and facing the French
          town of √âvian-les-Bains across the lake. Lausanne is located 62
          kilometres (38.5 miles) northeast of Geneva, its nearest larger
          neighbour. The municipality of Lausanne has a population of about
          140,000, making it the fourth largest city in Switzerland after Basel,
          Geneva, and Zurich, with the entire agglomeration area having about
          420,000 inhabitants (as of January 2019).

          The Cathedral of Notre Dame of Lausanne is a church located in the
          city of Lausanne, in the canton of Vaud in Switzerland. It belongs to
          the Evangelical Reformed Church of the Canton of Vaud. Construction of
          the cathedral began as early as 1170 by an original unknown master
          mason, for the use of the Catholic Church. Twenty years later, another
          master mason restarted construction until 1215. Finally a third
          engineer, Jean Cotereel, completed the majority of the existing
          cathedral including a porch, and two towers, one of which is the
          current day belfry. The other tower was never completed.

          The Jardin anglais (literally "English garden") is an urban park in
          Geneva, Switzerland, situated at the location of an ancient harbor and
          a wood. It marks the beginning of the Quai Gustave-Ador. The park was
          created in 1855. In 1863 the building process of the Pont du
          Mont-Blanc changed the park to its actual form a trapezoid/trapezium
          of 25430 m<sup>2</sup>. The Park hosts the Le monument national and
          the L'horloge fleurie (or Flower clock), besides several pavilions, a
          sculpted bronze fountain by Alexis Andre and a coffeehouse. Annually,
          it hosts the Geneva Christmas Market.

          The Jet d'Eau (French, Water-Jet) is a large fountain in Geneva,
          Switzerland and is one of the city's most famous landmarks, being
          featured on the city's official tourism web site and on the official
          logo for Geneva's hosting of group stage matches at UEFA Euro 2008.
          Situated where Lake Geneva exits as the Rh√¥ne, it is visible
          throughout the city and from the air, even when flying over Geneva at
          an altitude of ten kilometres (33,000 ft). Five hundred litres (130 US
          gal) of water per second are jetted to an altitude of 140 metres (460
          ft) by two 500 kW pumps, operating at 2,400 V, consuming one megawatt
          of electricity (3,000,000 KWh and costing 510,000 CHF per year).
